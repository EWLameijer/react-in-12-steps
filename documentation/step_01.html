    <h1>Step 1: let a tool create a React app for you</h1>

    <p>
        React applications can be created by hand, at least in theory.
        In practice, setting up an app with React is so complicated, that you almost always us a special program for it.
        Like with many things in the JavaScript ecosystem, there are many ways to create a react app. I will list some
        of the best-known below: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Create React App - the original one, used in many tutorials, but basically deprecated/unsuitable for use in
            2023</li>
        <li>Vite: an App creator that can create apps with many other libaries besides React. Is really fast in building
            apps</li>
        <li>Next.js: a React "Framework", with lots of functions that React by itself does not have</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Create-React-App</h3>
    <p>Create-React-App is the original React app builder. However, it is not very much maintained anymore, using it
        will give many security vulnerabilities.
        It's not terrible for hobby projects, but you definitely don't want vulnerabilities in production projects, so
        another option to create react apps is better.
    </p>
    <h3>Vite</h3>
    <p>You can consider Vite the spiritual successor of Create-React-App: it creates React apps, it just does everything
        faster if you allow it to use the SWC
        builder instead of the default Babel/Webpack. Definitely a better option than Create-React-App.
    </p>
    <h3>Next.js</h3>
    <p>Whereas React was always promoted as a library, which helped developers with a few core things, but gave them the
        freedom to pick and choose complementary
        JavaScript libraries for specific functionality, like routing, many developers prefer all-included solutions.
        Next.js is such a 'batteries-included'
        solution, in contrast to React it is really not a library anymore, but more of a framework, comparable to say
        Angular.
    </p>
    <p>Is that good? Should you use a library or a framework? In software design, it is said, there are no solutions,
        only tradeoffs. If you had to choose between
        Vite and Next.js:<ul>
        <li>Vite: advantages: has faster build time so regular development will likely go a bit faster. Allows you to
        import other libraries, so you can adapt the program
        better to specific needs.</li>
        <li>Next.js: You don't need to spend time looking for specific libraries and hope they play nicely together.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>What to choose? For a relatively simple app, Next.js is likely the easiest choice. The build speed and versatily of
        Vite are only a major advantage on large projects.
        So for a demo app like this, Next.js might be a slightly better choice; but as a majority of projects still use
        React and Vite may make builds a bit
        more quickly, I'll use Vite here; I once had to include a routing library, which was not that hard. But
        basically this decision could be defended either way,
        I would not argue strongly against someone who wanted to make a demo app in Next.js.
    </p>

    <h2>What does React do, exactly?</h2>
    <p>I said above that React is a library, not a framework. But a library for what, exactly? After all, you can make
        fully interactive websites in "Vanilla"
        JavaScript, no frameworks/libraries needed.</p>
    <p>However, regular JavaScript websites have some problems. First, they tend to sprawl to great html-files and
        scripts of hundreds of lines of code,
        making it hard to find any one part of functionality that needs to be modified or debugged. Second, it is easy
        for them to change data somewhere
        and not update the data on all places where it is needed in the browser. Third, even if you update data in the
        browser, it is far too easy to do that by
        producing buggy, slow code.
    </p>
    <p>The React library aims to alleviate these problems.</p>

    </p> React encourages you to make your app consist not one one large blob of HTML/JS, but out of many smaller
    components, which you can combine like lego blocks (or classes in other programming languages, like Java). In fact,
    the original React versions offered
    classes inheriting from React.Component as the basis of those components (nowadays we mostly use functions,
    so-called 'functional components').
    </p>
    <p>Next, React makes it easier to update everything correctly as values change. For that, React uses so-called
        "state". Components can have state, which basically is a set of variables that are 'watched over' by React, and
        when the state of a component changes, React redraws the component.
    </p>
    <p>Finally, React does its best to make the software fast; it redraws components as efficiently as possible and as
        little as possible, keeping account
        of the state. To work optimally, it may make further demands of your code, like giving each item in a list a
        unique key, but overall the updating works
        smoothly. Especially as React uses a trick called the "Virtual DOM", in which all changes are drawn, and which
        is then wholesale written to the browser-
        whereas normal JavaScript does every update separately in the browser, which is a slower process.
    </p>

    <h2>Getting started</h2>
    <p>Go to the folder in which you want to create a folder hosting the React application, open a command prompt there
        (in Windows Explorer: change the
        address bar of the window, which usually shows something like `C:\GoogleDrive221122` into `cmd` and then press
        ENTER).
    </p>
    <p>Then run:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <pre>npm create vite@latest</pre>.
        </li>
        <li>Fill in the name of the project, for example
            <pre>react-in-12-steps</pre>
        </li>
        <li>Choose the other values, like
            <pre>React</pre>.I would also recommend the
            <pre>JavaScript + SWC</pre> option. (TypeScript is also a good option
            but a bit more complicated, so for this introduction I'll stick with JavaScript)
        </li>
        <li>Follow the instructions. In my case:
            <pre>
                    cd react-in-12-steps
                    npm install
                    npm run dev</pre>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>I now go to  http://127.0.0.1:5173/ where a default app with counting button is displayed!</p>
