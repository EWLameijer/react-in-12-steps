    <h1>React in 12 steps - learn and repeat the basics of React</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The internet is full of React tutorials, there is not much sense in making another one be it that I am looking
        for something that is
    <ol>
        <li>Fairly up-to date</li>
        <li>Is more introductory, giving a <em>basis</em> for react instead of marching all the way to contexts and
            stores, which are not that useful in projects for beginners</li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <p>One of the problems of tutorials is that people follow steps, and afterwards forget everything; similar to the practicals I did as a chemistry student. 
        To make things stick, learning science describes "desirable difficulties." This tutorial aims to help the learning process in three ways:
    
    <ol>
        <li>It clearly gives an overview/step by step plan, so you can link each action to its greater purpose.</li>
        <li>It provides a handy checklist of terms that you can study later with a system like Anki or my own FermiEn</li>
        <li>It tries to encourage you to do 'post-tutorial' work. More on that below.</li>
    </ol></p>

<h3>What do I mean with post-tutorial work?</h3>
<p>If you have followed this tutorial to a certain level (say level 3 or level 4), it helps if you try to reach the same level independently with an app of your 
    own the next day. Like any professional developer, you are allowed to use Google. If you get stuck, you can always check your old code or this tutorial, but 
it also means that your knowledge is not yet solid enough and you should try again the next day or the earliest opportunity after that.</p>

<h3>The steps!</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Create something that works - <a href="./step_01.html">Let a tool create a react app for you</a></li>
    <li>Transform the template app into a very simple app of your own - Clean the demo app to make your own app basis</li>
    <li>Extend your app - Create your own components</li>
    <li>Use simple user input - Create simple input methods like buttons, learn to use state</li>
    <li>Use more complex user input - Learn to use controlled components for form input</li>
    <li>Create flexible displays: Learn to use ?: and map and keys to be flexible in the number of components</li>
</ol>
