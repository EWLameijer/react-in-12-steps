        Component: a sort of 'lego building block' you can use for websites; React allows you to write components, either class-based or function-based.
        Create-React-App: the old way to create applications in React; is not maintained well and should not be used anymore.
        import: used to import both libraries like "import React from 'react'" and components like "import App from './App.jsx'". Note the path specifier 
            (./ or ../ if the path starts in the parent directory of the file) for imports of components and other code you write yourself.
        index.html: the home page shown by most web apps (including React apps!)
        JSX: JavaScript XML: HTML-like construct that via some React magic will produce HTML in the front-end. Inside JSX, you can insert ordinary JavaScript code 
            between {}.
        Next.js: a framework that includes React and some other libraries that work well together 
        React: a library that helps make web-apps that are fast and have relatively few bugs.
        ReactDOM: a libary that React needs to work with web browsers (there is another library to make React work with mobile phones)
        root: the div in index.html where React will insert its main component.
        state: the value of important variables, which can/should impact the display of an app. State is central to React.
        Vite: a tool to easily create Web apps in many frameworks (not only React) and loads them quickly
