  <h1>Step 2: Transform the template app into a very simple app of your own </h1>

  <p>You now have a running app. But you likely want to make something very different from a counter app! Let's go over
    the files and modify them as needed,
    along the way I'll discuss some other useful things to know about React.
  </p>

  <h2>Index.html</h2>
  <p>By convention, most webpages are called "index.html", since that is the page automatically loaded by the server
    when it receives
    a HTTP request. If I would have an org.wubbo server, where the actual server ran at C:\website, a browser going to
    org.wubbo/lessons would actually
    load C:\website\lessons\index.html. Likely the name comes from the old days of the internet, where you wanted an
    index to explore which files
    from the server's directory you actually needed. Anyway, in all projects check for the location of the index.html,
    as that is usually the starting
    point for all JavaScript applications.</p>
  <p>But what should we look for at index.html? Well, it looks like</p>
  <pre>
&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="UTF-8" /&gt;
    &lt;link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/vite.svg" /&gt;
    &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" /&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Vite + React&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div id="root"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;script type="module" src="/src/main.jsx"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;        
</pre>
  <p>Most here is standard. I remove the icon link (don't need the vite icon), and change the title into something like
    ReactTest230723</p>
  <p>I wish to point out two further items.</p>
  <p>First, the div with id=root. This is where React will later insert the actual components.</p>
  <p>Second, the inclusion of the main.jsx script. This is the place where the React code is loaded. So let's check out
    the main.jsx! (after
    taking a final look at the new index.html)
  </p>
  <pre>
  &lt;!doctype html&gt;
  &lt;html lang="en"&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;meta charset="UTF-8" /&gt;
      &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" /&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;ReactTest230723&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;div id="root"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;script type="module" src="/src/main.jsx"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
  &lt;/html&gt;    
</pre>

  <h2>main.jsx</h2>
  <p>main.jsx is quite short:</p>
  <pre>
    import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import App from './App.jsx'
import './index.css'

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
)
  </pre>
  <p>First, it imports React and ReactDOM, which are the libraries necessary for using the basics of React (JSX, state), and for displaying its output on web pages, respectively.</p>
  <p>Then, it imports an App and an index.css</p>
  <p>index.css is undoubtedly the stylesheet for index.html, which is apparently imported via the script instead of directly in index.html.</p>
  <p>Note that in contrast to the first two imports, the last two imports start with './'. This means that they are on the 'ordinary' path in the src 
    directory, instead of in the node_modules directory.
  </p>
  <p>What the App does? We'll see soon. But basically, App is a React component, which are generally imported with statements like these.</p>
  <p>Then there is some 'React magic'. The ReactDOM.createRoot fills the root div in index.html with the contents of the App component. Again, notice some 
    things:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>The render method does not seem to take an ordinary string, array, object or even regex, but some literal that looks like HTML. This is a special 
      notation of React, called JSX (JavaScript XML)
    </li>
  </ol>
